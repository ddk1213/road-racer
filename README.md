# Game description
Title: Road Racer
</br>
By playing this game, you will feel the extreme thrill while passing by the pouring amount of random cars. Test your reaction speed and analyze each car's movement. You can move your car with left and right key on the kyeboard. If you pass the car, you will have an extra points, but if you crash with other cars, you will end up at the ending screen. You can see your score at the ending screen with the championship-winning Ferrari f2004 f1 car. Try to stay alive as much as you can and test your skills. Enjoy!
